#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0 and then prints
#"Hello World!" at the end.
i = 5
while i >= 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
else:
    print("Hello World!")

#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 30 (HINT: modulo).
x = 1
while x <= 30:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print(x)
    x += 1

#3. Create a while loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the
#number is divisible by 3.
y = 1
while y <= 30:
    if y % 3 != 0:
        print(y)
    y += 1

#4. Create a while loop that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, prints the result,
#and then breaks the loop if it's a 1.
while True:
    z = random.randint(1, 6)
    print(z)
    if z == 1:
        break

#5. Create a while loop that asks for a number input until the user inputs the number 0.
while True:
    zero = int(input("Give me a number; please input zero, you dont have to, but you should... "))
    if zero == 0:
        print("Thanks")
        break
    else:
        print("awwwww, dude why????")
